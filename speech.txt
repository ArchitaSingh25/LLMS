Women's empowerment (or female empowerment) may be defined in several method, including accepting women's viewpoints, making an effort to seek them and raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, equal status in society, better livelihood and training.[1][2][3] Women's empowerment equips and allows women to make life-determining decisions through the different societal problems.[3] They may have the opportunity to re-define gender roles or other such roles, which allow them more freedom to pursue desired goals.[1]

Women's empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics. Economic empowerment allows women to control and benefit from resources, assets, and income. It also aids in the ability to manage risks and improve women's well-being.[4] It can result in approaches to support trivialized genders in a particular political or social context.[5] While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of gender empowerment concerns people of any gender, stressing the distinction between biological and gender as a role. Women empowerment helps boost women's status through literacy, education, training and awareness creation.[6] Furthermore, women's empowerment refers to women's ability to make strategic life choices that were previously denied them.[7]

Nations, businesses, communities and groups may benefit from implementing programs and policies that adopt the notion of female empowerment.[8] Women's empowerment enhances the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.[9] Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing human rights and development.

Women's empowerment is key to economic and social outcomes. Benefits from projects that empower women are higher than those that just mainstream gender.[10] More than half of bilateral finance for agriculture and rural development already mainstreams gender, but only 6 percent treats gender as fundamental. If half of small-scale producers benefited from development interventions that focused on empowering women, it would significantly raise the incomes of an additional 58 million people and increase the resilience of an additional 235 million people.[10]

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), increasing women's empowerment is essential for women's well-being (Women for Women's problems) and has a positive impact on agricultural production, food security, diets and child nutrition.[10]

Several principles define women's empowerment, such as, for one to be empowered, one must come from a position of disempowerment. They must acquire empowerment rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Empowerment and disempowerment are relative to each other at a previous time; empowerment is a process rather than a product.[2]

Scholars have identified two forms of empowerment: economic empowerment and political empowerment.[11][12]

Economic
Since the 1980s, the push for neoliberalism prioritizes competitiveness and self-reliance as a measurement for economic success.[13] Individuals and their identifying communities that do not meet society's favored neoliberal standards are looked down upon and prone to lower their self-esteem.[13] Some groups who do not fit the preferable neoliberal image are the lower working class and the unemployed.[13]

Specifically, neoliberalism has negatively impacted women's self-worth through its welfare reform policies. Mary Corcoran et al. theorize that conservative welfare reformers believe welfare dependency is the cause of poverty.[14] This leads welfare reformers to widen the criteria for an individual to qualify as a welfare recipient, limiting the number of people dependent on welfare.[14] These criteria include: work requirements and time limits, rapidly pushing women into the labor market.[14][15] The active push for women to enter the labor market reinforces the notion that single mothers and unpaid care laborers are unproductive to the American economy.[15] In consequence, women are forced to settle for low-paying unstable jobs while having to manage their maternal and domestic responsibilities.[14] Scholars believe welfare reform's underlying purpose is to disempower women by suppressing women's agency and economic independence.[16][17][15] Women can counteract neoliberalism's social implications and welfare reform by creating opportunities for women's empowerment, like job training.[16][15][14]

In addition, policymakers are suggested to support job training to aid into entrance in the formal markets.[11] One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.[18]

Women's empowerment and achieving gender equality help society ensure the sustainable development of a country. Many world leaders and scholars have argued that sustainable development is impossible without gender equality and women's empowerment.[14] Sustainable development accepts environmental protection, social and economic development, including women's empowerment. In the context of women and development, empowerment must include more choices for women to make on their own.[19]

Strengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and bargaining power needed to address gender inequalities. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped countries are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.[18] Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they would not normally have; they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.

Race has an integral impact on women's empowerment in areas such as employment. Employment can help create empowerment for women. Many scholars suggest that when we discuss women's empowerment, discussing the different barriers that underprivileged women face, which make it more difficult for them to obtain empowerment in society, is important when examining the impact of race in connection to employment. Significantly examining how opportunities are structured by gender, race, and class can transpire social change. Work opportunities and the work environment can create empowerment for women. Empowerment in the workplace can positively affect job satisfaction and performance, having equality in the workplace can greatly increase the sense of empowerment.[20]

In the case women have the opportunity to settle for stable jobs, women of color encounter a lack of equal accessibility and privileges in work settings. They are faced with more disadvantages in the workplace. Patricia Parker argues that African American women's empowerment is their resistance to control, standing up for themselves and not conforming to societal norms and expectations. In connection to power, feminist perspectives look at empowerment as a form of resistance within systems of unequal power relations. Within the societal setting of race, gender, and class politics, African American women's empowerment in the work environment "can be seen as resistance to attempts to fix meanings of appropriate identity and behavior, where such meanings are interpreted as controlling, exploitative, and otherwise oppressive to African American women."[21] When talking about women's empowerment, many scholars suggest examining the social injustices on women in everyday organizational life that are influenced by race, class, and gender.

Another methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes microcredit.[22] Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low-interest rates without the requirement of collateral.[23] More specifically, they(micro-finance institutions) aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.[23] The success and efficiency of microcredit and micro-loans are controversial and constantly debated.[24] Some critics claim that microcredit alone does not guarantee women have control over the way the loan is used. Microfinance institutions do not address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit does not relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they do not have the time to be as active in the market as men.[23][25]

Political empowerment

Political empowerment supports creating policies that best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.[18] As of 2017, the global average of women who hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.[12] Further recommendations have been made to increase women's rights to vote, voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.[8] Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labor market and running their businesses. Policies that increase their bargaining power in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).[18] However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the household, in schools, and the ability to choose for oneself. Some theorists believe that women bargaining power and agency in the household must be achieved before they can move on to broader political participation.[26]

Women will be less likely to be selected to lead and be involved in politics to make decisions.[27] Women have been unable to become leaders in their communities due to financial, social and legal constraints.[27][28] Organizational and cultural limitations also affect women in the fields where men are dominant. Those industries include science, engineering, finance and much more.[27][28]

António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations mentions that women can gain knowledge, wisdom, and insights only if they are included equally in all aspects of society. Equal representation of women contributes to peace, reduces conflict, and support long-term sustainable development.[29] United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) raises the concern gender equality in party policies and platforms, and commits to take actions for supporting the presence and influence of women in political parties.[30] Erin Vilardi, the founder of VoteRunLead points out that it is an opportunity to create real change but to recognize social inequalities in women's access to political office despite the number of women who are standing up to volunteer on campaigns and run for office themselves.[29]

According to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to increase the participation of women in politics:[30]

Incorporating statement on gender equality into policy
Having a quota for women's involvement and election
Establishing goals for female representation
Increase the number of female candidates and train them
Increase women's presence in the campaign through greater media exposure
In line with the commitments of the UN, the World Intellectual Property Organization also recognizes that women's empowerment are crucial for sustainable economic, social, and cultural development.[31] WIPO's commitment to protect and value women's innovation and creativity is embodied in its Intellectual Property and Gender Action Plan (IPGAP), which raises awareness about the economic benefits of strengthening the role of women in innovative and creative activities, helps equip governments and stakeholders with data and policymaking tools to improve national ecosystems in support of women and girls, and delivers concrete impact-driven activities that encourage women's use of intellectual property in their entrepreneurial activities.[32] The IPGAP is an action framework to achieved economic equality and empowerment for women and girlswomen's empowerment worldwide.[32] In April 2023, WIPO Director General Daren Tang announced the organization's commitment to closing the gender gap and empowering women and girls around the world by encouraging them to utilize their intellectual property rights to support economic growth: "Our data shows that women are using the global intellectual property system less than men. And that's a loss for all of us. WIPO is working to close this gender gap in intellectual property".[33] This announcement was made during the World Intellectual Property Day 2023 celebration.

Digital things enhance political empowerment
Main article: Gender digital divide
Digital skills can facilitate women's engagement with local government and increase their decision-making power in their communities. The Women-gov project in Brazil and India, for instance, has helped women improve their understanding of and communication with local government via ICTs.[34] In Brazil, the project trained female community leaders to access and utilize online data on government health services to better respond to public health concerns in their communities. In India, the project worked with women's collectives to establish women-run, internet-connected community information centres to facilitate applications for government assistance (including welfare and entitlements), which in turn improved linkages between the collectives, local authorities and public institutions.[35]

Women with digital skills are better able to make their voices heard on local issues and influence the outcome of decisions that affect themselves and their communities. Digital skills can also empower women to participate in political movements.[34] For instance, the anonymity of ICTs may allow some women to avoid limitations on freedom of speech in repressive societies, while collective mobilization through online networks can enable women to campaign on gender-based issues.[35] Studies show an Iraqi women's group used a multimedia campaign, including an online component, to successfully lobby the Kurdish regional government to outlaw the practice of female genital mutilation.[36] Images taken on mobile phones and distributed via social media have called attention to domestic violence in China and influenced media treatment of court cases on forced abortion.[37]

According to FAO, there are seven success factors to empowering rural women through ICTs:[38]

Adapt content so that it is meaningful for them.
Create a safe environment for them to share and learn.
Be gender-sensitive.
Provide them with access and tools for sharing.
Build partnerships.
Provide the right blend of technologies.
Ensure sustainability.
The regulatory role of governments (at local, national, regional, and international levels) is crucial in addressing infrastructural barriers, harmonizing and making the regulatory environment inclusive and gender-responsive, and in protecting all stakeholders from fraud and crime
