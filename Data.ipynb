       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='Women\\'s empowerment (or female empowerment) may be defined in several method, including accepting women\\'s viewpoints, making an effort to seek them and raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, equal status in society, better livelihood and training.[1][2][3] Women\\'s empowerment equips and allows women to make life-determining decisions through the different societal problems.[3] They may have the opportunity to re-define gender roles or other such roles, which allow them more freedom to pursue desired goals.[1]\\n\\nWomen\\'s empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics. Economic empowerment allows women to control and benefit from resources, assets, and income. It also aids in the ability to manage risks and improve women\\'s well-being.[4] It can result in approaches to support trivialized genders in a particular political or social context.[5] While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of gender empowerment concerns people of any gender, stressing the distinction between biological and gender as a role. Women empowerment helps boost women\\'s status through literacy, education, training and awareness creation.[6] Furthermore, women\\'s empowerment refers to women\\'s ability to make strategic life choices that were previously denied them.[7]\\n\\nNations, businesses, communities and groups may benefit from implementing programs and policies that adopt the notion of female empowerment.[8] Women\\'s empowerment enhances the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.[9] Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing human rights and development.\\n\\nWomen\\'s empowerment is key to economic and social outcomes. Benefits from projects that empower women are higher than those that just mainstream gender.[10] More than half of bilateral finance for agriculture and rural development already mainstreams gender, but only 6 percent treats gender as fundamental. If half of small-scale producers benefited from development interventions that focused on empowering women, it would significantly raise the incomes of an additional 58 million people and increase the resilience of an additional 235 million people.[10]\\n\\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), increasing women\\'s empowerment is essential for women\\'s well-being (Women for Women\\'s problems) and has a positive impact on agricultural production, food security, diets and child nutrition.[10]\\n\\nSeveral principles define women\\'s empowerment, such as, for one to be empowered, one must come from a position of disempowerment. They must acquire empowerment rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Empowerment and disempowerment are relative to each other at a previous time; empowerment is a process rather than a product.[2]\\n\\nScholars have identified two forms of empowerment: economic empowerment and political empowerment.[11][12]\\n\\nEconomic\\nSince the 1980s, the push for neoliberalism prioritizes competitiveness and self-reliance as a measurement for economic success.[13] Individuals and their identifying communities that do not meet society\\'s favored neoliberal standards are looked down upon and prone to lower their self-esteem.[13] Some groups who do not fit the preferable neoliberal image are the lower working class and the unemployed.[13]\\n\\nSpecifically, neoliberalism has negatively impacted women\\'s self-worth through its welfare reform policies. Mary Corcoran et al. theorize that conservative welfare reformers believe welfare dependency is the cause of poverty.[14] This leads welfare reformers to widen the criteria for an individual to qualify as a welfare recipient, limiting the number of people dependent on welfare.[14] These criteria include: work requirements and time limits, rapidly pushing women into the labor market.[14][15] The active push for women to enter the labor market reinforces the notion that single mothers and unpaid care laborers are unproductive to the American economy.[15] In consequence, women are forced to settle for low-paying unstable jobs while having to manage their maternal and domestic responsibilities.[14] Scholars believe welfare reform\\'s underlying purpose is to disempower women by suppressing women\\'s agency and economic independence.[16][17][15] Women can counteract neoliberalism\\'s social implications and welfare reform by creating opportunities for women\\'s empowerment, like job training.[16][15][14]\\n\\nIn addition, policymakers are suggested to support job training to aid into entrance in the formal markets.[11] One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.[18]\\n\\nWomen\\'s empowerment and achieving gender equality help society ensure the sustainable development of a country. Many world leaders and scholars have argued that sustainable development is impossible without gender equality and women\\'s empowerment.[14] Sustainable development accepts environmental protection, social and economic development, including women\\'s empowerment. In the context of women and development, empowerment must include more choices for women to make on their own.[19]\\n\\nStrengthening women\\'s access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and bargaining power needed to address gender inequalities. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped countries are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.[18] Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they would not normally have; they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.\\n\\nRace has an integral impact on women\\'s empowerment in areas such as employment. Employment can help create empowerment for women. Many scholars suggest that when we discuss women\\'s empowerment, discussing the different barriers that underprivileged women face, which make it more difficult for them to obtain empowerment in society, is important when examining the impact of race in connection to employment. Significantly examining how opportunities are structured by gender, race, and class can transpire social change. Work opportunities and the work environment can create empowerment for women. Empowerment in the workplace can positively affect job satisfaction and performance, having equality in the workplace can greatly increase the sense of empowerment.[20]\\n\\nIn the case women have the opportunity to settle for stable jobs, women of color encounter a lack of equal accessibility and privileges in work settings. They are faced with more disadvantages in the workplace. Patricia Parker argues that African American women\\'s empowerment is their resistance to control, standing up for themselves and not conforming to societal norms and expectations. In connection to power, feminist perspectives look at empowerment as a form of resistance within systems of unequal power relations. Within the societal setting of race, gender, and class politics, African American women\\'s empowerment in the work environment \"can be seen as resistance to attempts to fix meanings of appropriate identity and behavior, where such meanings are interpreted as controlling, exploitative, and otherwise oppressive to African American women.\"[21] When talking about women\\'s empowerment, many scholars suggest examining the social injustices on women in everyday organizational life that are influenced by race, class, and gender.\\n\\nAnother methodology for women\\'s economic empowerment also includes microcredit.[22] Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low-interest rates without the requirement of collateral.[23] More specifically, they(micro-finance institutions) aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.[23] The success and efficiency of microcredit and micro-loans are controversial and constantly debated.[24] Some critics claim that microcredit alone does not guarantee women have control over the way the loan is used. Microfinance institutions do not address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit does not relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they do not have the time to be as active in the market as men.[23][25]\\n\\nPolitical empowerment\\n\\nBusinesswoman Ivanka Trump (right) and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe attending the World Assembly for Women in Tokyo to speak on women\\'s rights and empowerment, 2017\\nPolitical empowerment supports creating policies that best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.[18] As of 2017, the global average of women who hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.[12] Further recommendations have been made to increase women\\'s rights to vote, voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.[8] Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labor market and running their businesses. Policies that increase their bargaining power in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).[18] However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the household, in schools, and the ability to choose for oneself. Some theorists believe that women bargaining power and agency in the household must be achieved before they can move on to broader political participation.[26]\\n\\nWomen will be less likely to be selected to lead and be involved in politics to make decisions.[27] Women have been unable to become leaders in their communities due to financial, social and legal constraints.[27][28] Organizational and cultural limitations also affect women in the fields where men are dominant. Those industries include science, engineering, finance and much more.[27][28]\\n\\nAntónio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations mentions that women can gain knowledge, wisdom, and insights only if they are included equally in all aspects of society. Equal representation of women contributes to peace, reduces conflict, and support long-term sustainable development.[29] United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) raises the concern gender equality in party policies and platforms, and commits to take actions for supporting the presence and influence of women in political parties.[30] Erin Vilardi, the founder of VoteRunLead points out that it is an opportunity to create real change but to recognize social inequalities in women\\'s access to political office despite the number of women who are standing up to volunteer on campaigns and run for office themselves.[29]\\n\\nAccording to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to increase the participation of women in politics:[30]\\n\\nIncorporating statement on gender equality into policy\\nHaving a quota for women\\'s involvement and election\\nEstablishing goals for female representation\\nIncrease the number of female candidates and train them\\nIncrease women\\'s presence in the campaign through greater media exposure\\nIn line with the commitments of the UN, the World Intellectual Property Organization also recognizes that women\\'s empowerment are crucial for sustainable economic, social, and cultural development.[31] WIPO\\'s commitment to protect and value women\\'s innovation and creativity is embodied in its Intellectual Property and Gender Action Plan (IPGAP), which raises awareness about the economic benefits of strengthening the role of women in innovative and creative activities, helps equip governments and stakeholders with data and policymaking tools to improve national ecosystems in support of women and girls, and delivers concrete impact-driven activities that encourage women\\'s use of intellectual property in their entrepreneurial activities.[32] The IPGAP is an action framework to achieved economic equality and empowerment for women and girlswomen\\'s empowerment worldwide.[32] In April 2023, WIPO Director General Daren Tang announced the organization\\'s commitment to closing the gender gap and empowering women and girls around the world by encouraging them to utilize their intellectual property rights to support economic growth: \"Our data shows that women are using the global intellectual property system less than men. And that\\'s a loss for all of us. WIPO is working to close this gender gap in intellectual property\".[33] This announcement was made during the World Intellectual Property Day 2023 celebration.\\n\\nDigital things enhance political empowerment\\nMain article: Gender digital divide\\nDigital skills can facilitate women\\'s engagement with local government and increase their decision-making power in their communities. The Women-gov project in Brazil and India, for instance, has helped women improve their understanding of and communication with local government via ICTs.[34] In Brazil, the project trained female community leaders to access and utilize online data on government health services to better respond to public health concerns in their communities. In India, the project worked with women\\'s collectives to establish women-run, internet-connected community information centres to facilitate applications for government assistance (including welfare and entitlements), which in turn improved linkages between the collectives, local authorities and public institutions.[35]\\n\\nWomen with digital skills are better able to make their voices heard on local issues and influence the outcome of decisions that affect themselves and their communities. Digital skills can also empower women to participate in political movements.[34] For instance, the anonymity of ICTs may allow some women to avoid limitations on freedom of speech in repressive societies, while collective mobilization through online networks can enable women to campaign on gender-based issues.[35] Studies show an Iraqi women\\'s group used a multimedia campaign, including an online component, to successfully lobby the Kurdish regional government to outlaw the practice of female genital mutilation.[36] Images taken on mobile phones and distributed via social media have called attention to domestic violence in China and influenced media treatment of court cases on forced abortion.[37]\\n\\nAccording to FAO, there are seven success factors to empowering rural women through ICTs:[38]\\n\\nAdapt content so that it is meaningful for them.\\nCreate a safe environment for them to share and learn.\\nBe gender-sensitive.\\nProvide them with access and tools for sharing.\\nBuild partnerships.\\nProvide the right blend of technologies.\\nEnsure sustainability.\\nThe regulatory role of governments (at local, national, regional, and international levels) is crucial in addressing infrastructural barriers, harmonizing and making the regulatory environment inclusive and gender-responsive, and in protecting all stakeholders from fraud and crime')]"

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0.3\\nfor both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-\\nprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the\\nRecurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-\\nParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on\\nattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\\nmulti-headed self-attention.\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based\\non recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Economic empowerment allows women to control and benefit from resources, assets, and income. It also aids in the ability to manage risks and improve women\\'s well-being.[4] It can result in approaches to support trivialized genders in a particular political or social context.[5] While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of gender empowerment concerns people of any gender, stressing the distinction between biological and gender as a role. Women empowerment helps boost women\\'s status through literacy, education, training and awareness creation.[6] Furthermore, women\\'s empowerment refers to women\\'s ability to make strategic life choices that were previously denied them.[7]\\n\\nNations, businesses, communities and groups may benefit from implementing programs and policies that adopt the notion of female empowerment.[8] Women\\'s empowerment enhances the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.[9] Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing human rights and development.\\n\\nWomen\\'s empowerment is key to economic and social outcomes. Benefits from projects that empower women are higher than those that just mainstream gender.[10] More than half of bilateral finance for agriculture and rural development already mainstreams gender, but only 6 percent treats gender as fundamental. If half of small-scale producers benefited from development interventions that focused on empowering women, it would significantly raise the incomes of an additional 58 million people and increase the resilience of an additional 235 million people.[10]\\n\\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), increasing women\\'s empowerment is essential for women\\'s well-being (Women for Women\\'s problems) and has a positive impact on agricultural production, food security, diets and child nutrition.[10]\\n\\nSeveral principles define women\\'s empowerment, such as, for one to be empowered, one must come from a position of disempowerment. They must acquire empowerment rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Empowerment and disempowerment are relative to each other at a previous time; empowerment is a process rather than a product.[2]\\n\\nScholars have identified two forms of empowerment: economic empowerment and political empowerment.[11][12]\\n\\nEconomic\\nSince the 1980s, the push for neoliberalism prioritizes competitiveness and self-reliance as a measurement for economic success.[13] Individuals and their identifying communities that do not meet society\\'s favored neoliberal standards are looked down upon and prone to lower their self-esteem.[13] Some groups who do not fit the preferable neoliberal image are the lower working class and the unemployed.[13]\\n\\nSpecifically, neoliberalism has negatively impacted women\\'s self-worth through its welfare reform policies. Mary Corcoran et al. theorize that conservative welfare reformers believe welfare dependency is the cause of poverty.[14] This leads welfare reformers to widen the criteria for an individual to qualify as a welfare recipient, limiting the number of people dependent on welfare.[14] These criteria include: work requirements and time limits, rapidly pushing women into the labor market.[14][15] The active push for women to enter the labor market reinforces the notion that single mothers and unpaid care laborers are unproductive to the American economy.[15] In consequence, women are forced to settle for low-paying unstable jobs while having to manage their maternal and domestic responsibilities.[14] Scholars believe welfare reform\\'s underlying purpose is to disempower women by suppressing women\\'s agency and economic independence.[16][17][15] Women can counteract neoliberalism\\'s social implications and welfare reform by creating opportunities for women\\'s empowerment, like job training.[16][15][14]\\n\\nIn addition, policymakers are suggested to support job training to aid into entrance in the formal markets.[11] One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.[18]\\n\\nWomen\\'s empowerment and achieving gender equality help society ensure the sustainable development of a country. Many world leaders and scholars have argued that sustainable development is impossible without gender equality and women\\'s empowerment.[14] Sustainable development accepts environmental protection, social and economic development, including women\\'s empowerment. In the context of women and development, empowerment must include more choices for women to make on their own.[19]\\n\\nStrengthening women\\'s access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and bargaining power needed to address gender inequalities. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped countries are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.[18] Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they would not normally have; they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.\\n\\nRace has an integral impact on women\\'s empowerment in areas such as employment. Employment can help create empowerment for women. Many scholars suggest that when we discuss women\\'s empowerment, discussing the different barriers that underprivileged women face, which make it more difficult for them to obtain empowerment in society, is important when examining the impact of race in connection to employment. Significantly examining how opportunities are structured by gender, race, and class can transpire social change. Work opportunities and the work environment can create empowerment for women. Empowerment in the workplace can positively affect job satisfaction and performance, having equality in the workplace can greatly increase the sense of empowerment.[20]\\n\\nIn the case women have the opportunity to settle for stable jobs, women of color encounter a lack of equal accessibility and privileges in work settings. They are faced with more disadvantages in the workplace. Patricia Parker argues that African American women\\'s empowerment is their resistance to control, standing up for themselves and not conforming to societal norms and expectations. In connection to power, feminist perspectives look at empowerment as a form of resistance within systems of unequal power relations. Within the societal setting of race, gender, and class politics, African American women\\'s empowerment in the work environment \"can be seen as resistance to attempts to fix meanings of appropriate identity and behavior, where such meanings are interpreted as controlling, exploitative, and otherwise oppressive to African American women.\"[21] When talking about women\\'s empowerment, many scholars suggest examining the social injustices on women in everyday organizational life that are influenced by race, class, and gender.\\n\\nAnother methodology for women\\'s economic empowerment also includes microcredit.[22] Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low-interest rates without the requirement of collateral.[23] More specifically, they(micro-finance institutions) aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.[23] The success and efficiency of microcredit and micro-loans are controversial and constantly debated.[24] Some critics claim that microcredit alone does not guarantee women have control over the way the loan is used. Microfinance institutions do not address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit does not relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they do not have the time to be as active in the market as men.[23][25]\\n\\nPolitical empowerment\\n\\nBusinesswoman Ivanka Trump (right) and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe attending the World Assembly for Women in Tokyo to speak on women\\'s rights and empowerment, 2017\\nPolitical empowerment supports creating policies that best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.[18] As of 2017, the global average of women who hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.[12] Further recommendations have been made to increase women\\'s rights to vote, voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.[8] Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labor market and running their businesses. Policies that increase their bargaining power in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).[18] However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the household, in schools, and the ability to choose for oneself. Some theorists believe that women bargaining power and agency in the household must be achieved before they can move on to broader political participation.[26]\\n\\nWomen will be less likely to be selected to lead and be involved in politics to make decisions.[27] Women have been unable to become leaders in their communities due to financial, social and legal constraints.[27][28] Organizational and cultural limitations also affect women in the fields where men are dominant. Those industries include science, engineering, finance and much more.[27][28]\\n\\nAntónio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations mentions that women can gain knowledge, wisdom, and insights only if they are included equally in all aspects of society. Equal representation of women contributes to peace, reduces conflict, and support long-term sustainable development.[29] United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) raises the concern gender equality in party policies and platforms, and commits to take actions for supporting the presence and influence of women in political parties.[30] Erin Vilardi, the founder of VoteRunLead points out that it is an opportunity to create real change but to recognize social inequalities in women\\'s access to political office despite the number of women who are standing up to volunteer on campaigns and run for office themselves.[29]\\n\\nAccording to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to increase the participation of women in politics:[30]\\n\\nIncorporating statement on gender equality into policy\\nHaving a quota for women\\'s involvement and election\\nEstablishing goals for female representation\\nIncrease the number of female candidates and train them\\nIncrease women\\'s presence in the campaign through greater media exposure\\nIn line with the commitments of the UN, the World Intellectual Property Organization also recognizes that women\\'s empowerment are crucial for sustainable economic, social, and cultural development.[31] WIPO\\'s commitment to protect and value women\\'s innovation and creativity is embodied in its Intellectual Property and Gender Action Plan (IPGAP), which raises awareness about the economic benefits of strengthening the role of women in innovative and creative activities, helps equip governments and stakeholders with data and policymaking tools to improve national ecosystems in support of women and girls, and delivers concrete impact-driven activities that encourage women\\'s use of intellectual property in their entrepreneurial activities.[32] The IPGAP is an action framework to achieved economic equality and empowerment for women and girlswomen\\'s empowerment worldwide.[32] In April 2023, WIPO Director General Daren Tang announced the organization\\'s commitment to closing the gender gap and empowering women and girls around the world by encouraging them to utilize their intellectual property rights to support economic growth: \"Our data shows that women are using the global intellectual property system less than men. And that\\'s a loss for all of us. WIPO is working to close this gender gap in intellectual property\".[33] This announcement was made during the World Intellectual Property Day 2023 celebration.\\n\\nDigital things enhance political empowerment\\nMain article: Gender digital divide\\nDigital skills can facilitate women\\'s engagement with local government and increase their decision-making power in their communities. The Women-gov project in Brazil and India, for instance, has helped women improve their understanding of and communication with local government via ICTs.[34] In Brazil, the project trained female community leaders to access and utilize online data on government health services to better respond to public health concerns in their communities. In India, the project worked with women\\'s collectives to establish women-run, internet-connected community information centres to facilitate applications for government assistance (including welfare and entitlements), which in turn improved linkages between the collectives, local authorities and public institutions.[35]\\n\\nWomen with digital skills are better able to make their voices heard on local issues and influence the outcome of decisions that affect themselves and their communities. Digital skills can also empower women to participate in political movements.[34] For instance, the anonymity of ICTs may allow some women to avoid limitations on freedom of speech in repressive societies, while collective mobilization through online networks can enable women to campaign on gender-based issues.[35] Studies show an Iraqi women\\'s group used a multimedia campaign, including an online component, to successfully lobby the Kurdish regional government to outlaw the practice of female genital mutilation.[36] Images taken on mobile phones and distributed via social media have called attention to domestic violence in China and influenced media treatment of court cases on forced abortion.[37]\\n\\nAccording to FAO, there are seven success factors to empowering rural women through ICTs:[38]\\n\\nAdapt content so that it is meaningful for them.\\nCreate a safe environment for them to share and learn.\\nBe gender-sensitive.\\nProvide them with access and tools for sharing.\\nBuild partnerships.\\nProvide the right blend of technologies.\\nEnsure sustainability.\\nThe regulatory role of governments (at local, national, regional, and international levels) is crucial in addressing infrastructural barriers, harmonizing and making the regulatory environment inclusive and gender-responsive, and in protecting all stakeholders from fraud and crime')]"

    "HTMLHeaderSplitter is a \"structure-aware\" chunker that splits text at the HTML element level and adds metadata for each header \"relevent\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by element or combine elements with the same metadata, with the objectives of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitters as part of a chunking pipeline."
